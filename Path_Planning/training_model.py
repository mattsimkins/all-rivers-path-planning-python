class BuildGrid:
    
    '''Trains a model (grid) by iteratively reading in 2D trajectories. After
    training the model the class calculates a quai-average trajectory given
    an arbitrary start location. The calculated trajectory works by navigating
    the trained grid. After training, a start location can be passed. If the
    start location is located on, or near a path of one or more of
    the training trajectories a psuedo-average trajectory is returned. The
    returned path (calc_traj) roughly describes an average trajectory in that
    it captures an amalgam of training trajectories. However, it is also not
    a true 'average' because it adheres to a valid path. For example, if one
    training trajectory steers left around an obstacle while the other steers
    right, the calc_traj will either go left or right, but it will not steer 
    through the obstacle as a true average would. Additionally, if training
    trajectories contain loops, calc_traj will bypass the loop. For this reason
    this algorithm is unsuitable for trajectories that should include loops, 
    or more specifically, trajectores that should cross its own path at
    points.
    Grid spacing is a critical parameter. Small grid spacings with large
    training trajectories result in a larger grid. While the model learns
    and calculates calc_traj in linear time, the algorithmic memory complexity
    grows roughly by order n^2 where n relates to the size of the trajectory,
    or inversely to the node spacing size.

        on the trajectory characteristics, and the node spacing value is
        critical to performance. Core to this algorithm is the grid of nodes
        being established. The geometry of the grid is given below with "*"
        representing the nodes, and connecting lines representing the grid
        spacing. The grid resembles a ternary plot, however, index assigment
        was selected so that it more easily integrates with cartesian space.
        The lower left node is at index [0, 0], and has a cartesian coordinate
        of (0, 0). the node to its right its at [1, 0], the node to its upper
        rigth is at [0, 1], and the node directly above it is at [2, 0]. 
        Node spacing provides the context between grid indices and cartesian
        grid space. For example, the node to the imediate right of the lower
        left node is at the location (node_spacing, 0)

        easiest way to change the behavior of PVF. As written, PVF is heavily
        biased towards the most recent training trajectories and the order of
        training matters.
        
        Nodes are updated with a vector that goes from one coordinate in a
        trajectory to the next. The node is "visited" when a trajectroy
        coordinate passes within its "trident". If the node was never visited
        then its parameters are populated with the vector components. However,
        if the node was visited previously the update must consider the vector
        components that were already present for that node. In that case, the
        update includes a series of vector operations. Behaviorally, this
        function causes the last training trajectory to have a dominant
        effect over trajectories that were previously used for training.
        
        The parameter direction_angle significantly affects performance, and
        was under consideration for being added as a keyword argument. It sets
        a threshold for how different the direction of an update vector can be
        from a previously learned node vector. The purpose is best described
        for pathes going to and from dead ends. Vectors along such paths going
        to the dead end and from, will be directed rougly 180 degrees appart.
        The path from the dead end is considered more relevant so the pathes 
        to the dead end are entirely overwritten. A 180 degree difference is
        achieved by setting direction_angle = 90 degrees, i.e. 90 degrees to
        the left, and 90 to the right of an update vector. However, using an
        angle much less than 90 degrees, such as 40 degrees, was found to
